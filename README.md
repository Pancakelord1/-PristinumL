PristiniumL(or simply Pristinium) is a high-level, one of a kind interpreted language designed for making languages, it's a unique object-oriented language made in
python, following the style of Python and Haskell(indents instead of braces for scopes and a simple, easy to learn syntax while also being extremely versatile)
along with the comforting and useful features of Java and C++. We all know that the most popular choices for creating languages are Java and C++ but have you ever 
wondered why? Because of things Python and other languages don't have such as more intricate classes and easy use of the Visitor Pattern, sure python is really nice 
to code in with the object-oriented-programming and satisfying tab button for whenever you want to define scopes rather than clunky braces but does it really have 
what you need to make a programming language without copious amounts of stress? The answer is no. With this new language, we eliminate that stress and tedious
effort, by adding utilities from Java and C++ such as the *final* modifier or *.Visitor* dot notation method as well as adding some of our own neat syntax, once you
use Pristinium, you won't want to stop.

EXAMPLE:

Visitor pattern is a really powerful and widely-used way of solving the Expression Problem, a problem with the concept of creating languages which has plagued 
language hackers for decades. As I was writing this language, I used Visitor pattern in my code and by lord it is not fun in python and most other languages,
however, in Java and C++ it's a piece of cake! Wouldn't it be nice if python had something like that for Visitor pattern and the abundance of bits and bobs in those 2 languages which make creating a language bareable? Well your dream has come true!
